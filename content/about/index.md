## I work where strategy meets story. I take messy problems, find the signal, and turn it into something people can understand, trust, and act on.
Over the last five years in marketing and brand management, I’ve built and led campaigns that grow awareness, deepen engagement, and move people from “interesting” to “I’m in.” I’ve run digital initiatives, supported product and brand launches, and led cross-functional teams with one goal in mind: make the work land, not just look good.

What I’m known for is the combination: problem solving and presentations. I don’t just build the plan. I can walk into a room, translate complexity, and get alignment without losing the nuance. Storytelling is my edge, but execution is my backbone.
